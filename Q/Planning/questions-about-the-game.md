Subject: Questions About the Q Game

To CEOS,

We have a few questions about the specifics of the game listed below.

Question 1:

What does "current round" mean?

Follow up:
Does this mean you and the next n-1 number of players or the first player to start the game and the next n-1 number of people.

Question 2:

Does the referee have to draw from speicific position in the collection when exchanging or replinshing?
Question 3:

A player requests placement; another player uses all tiles, does the game continue?

Follow up:

We are confused about the second bullet of ending the game and the last paragraph of the page.
It says "at the end of a turn if a player has placed all tiles in possession", the game ends. However, there is a contradictiory statement in the paragraph below. It states, "Once a plyaer has requested the placement of tiles, the current round of turns cannot end the game."

Best,
Dilan and Oliver
