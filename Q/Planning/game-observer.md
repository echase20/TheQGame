1. Interface of the component
The game-observer mechanism should have a user-friendly interface that allows the user to easily navigate and interact with the system. The interface should include the following components:

- A dashboard that displays the current state of the game, including the score and any other relevant information.
class game_observer:

    def __init__(self, game_state):
        # Initialize the view

    def render(self):
        # Renders the current game state

    def update_state(self, new_state):
        # Update the rendering based on the game state
    
    def on_mouse_click(self):
        # Shows the next turn after a mouse click by the client

2. Interaction with the observer's view
A single person may wish to interact with the observer's view in a number of ways. For example, they may want to:
 - Scrollable functionality to view the game board
 - A pause or quit function

3. Observer's view interacting with existing systems
- The view will rely on the game state for its information regarding player, player_scores, tiles, and actions made to update the map.
