# The Q Game

The Q game is a spinoff of the board game Qwirkle. The Q Game involves 2-4 players who try to earn as many points as possible by placing their tiles. Each tile placement earns points and potentially bonus points by placing in contigious sequences, completing a Q or placing the rest of the players tiles. The game ends when either a player places all their tiles, all players in a round pass or exchange, or all players are kicked because of invalid moves.

# Scoring

If the player requests a placement, the referee checks whether it is legal and constructs the extended map. Based on this new map, the referee assigns points for a turn as follows:
- A player receives one point per tile placed.

- A player receives one point per tile in a contiguous sequence of tiles (in a row or column) that contains at least one of its newly placed tiles extends.

- A player receives 6 bonus points for completing a Q, which is a contiguous sequence of tiles that contains all shapes or all colors and nothing else.

- A player also receives 6 bonus points for placing all tiles in its possession.

- The referee keeps track of the scores on a per turn basis and shares the scores of all players with the player to whom it grants a turn.
  
  
# Ending a Game

The game ends if one of the following condition holds:

- at the end of a round if all remaining players pass or replace their tiles;

- at the end of a turn if a player has placed all tiles in its possession; or

- there are no players left after a turn.


## Usage

To work on this project and run the program through a terminal one must use the command:
```
pip install -e .
```
This command allows for all of the dependices to reference each other, allowing the imports to work. 

There are a few scripts that one might wish to run to simulate some functionality during the game. <br>

- `xgames` in `/7` which simualtes a game with some players.
- `xgames-with-observer` in `/8` which simualtes a game with some players and an observer GUI if you wish by using the --show command.
- `xbaddies` in `/9` which simulates a game with some good behaving players and some not so nice players that attempt to cheat. 
- `xclients` and `xserver` in `/10` simulates a server client relationship over TCP between the referee and the players. 

<p> For all the scripts above, there is examples of input into the script in their respective /Tests/ folder.
