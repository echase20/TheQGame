# The Q Game

The Q game is a spinoff of the board game Qwirkle. The Q Game involves 2-4 players who try to earn as many points as possible by placing their tiles. Each tile placement earns points and potentially bonus points by placing in contigious sequences, completing a Q or placing the rest of the players tiles. The game ends when either a player places all their tiles, all players in a round pass or exchange, or all players are kicked because of invalid moves.

## Run Game

To work on this project and run the program through a terminal one must use the command:
```
pip install -e .

This command allows for all of the dependices to reference each other, allowing the imports to work. 

There are a few scripts that one might wish to run to simulate some functionality during the game. <br>


<p> In /7, there exists a script xgames. To run this script, </p>
<p> In /8, there exists a script xgames-with-observer. To run this script, you can write --show to show the observer when the game is finished </p>
<p> In /9, there exists a runnable xbaddies script.
